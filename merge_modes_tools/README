The script merge_modes.py is used to merge all the modes from QPAD output.
Before using this script, you should delete all the comments in qpinput.json

#### HOW TO USE ####

1. You should put these three files: merge_modes.py, helper.py, README into a folder (Let's call it 'merge_modes_tools', for example). Then you need to move this 'merge_modes_tools' folder to the directory where your QPAD input file (qpinput.json) is located.

2. Navigate into the 'merge_modes_tools' folder, then execute:

   python3 merge_modes.py -a <angle>

   where the angle is the angle in polar coordinate (unit is degree). For example, you can do:

   python3 merge_modes.py -a 90

   Then it will generate folders called 'Merged_angle_90' in the corresponding subdirectories.
